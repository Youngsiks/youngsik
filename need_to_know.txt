When System.currentTimeMillis() (line 4) is [invoked].

the variable is incremented or decremented by 1, then the new value of the variable is returned.

the prefixes ++x and ??x are referred to, respectively, as 
[the preincrement operator] and [the predecrement operator]; and the suffixes x++ and x?? are referred
to, respectively, as [the postincrement operator] and [the postdecrement operator].

The increment operator ++ and the decrement operator ?? can [be applied to] all integer and
floating-point types.

You can always [assign] a value to a numeric variable whose type supports a larger range of
values;

for instance, you can [assign] a long value to a float variable.

Casting a variable of a type with a small range to a variable of a type with a larger range is
known as [widening a type]. Casting a variable of a type with a large range to a variable of a
type with a smaller range is known as [narrowing a type].

The character data type, char, is used to [represent] a single character. A character literal is
enclosed in single quotation marks.

A string literal must be enclosed in [quotation marks]. A character literal is a single character
enclosed in [single quotation marks]. So "A" is a string, and 'A' is a character.

[Mapping] a character to its binary representation is called encoding.

There are different ways to [encode] a character.

[How characters are encoded] is defined by an encoding scheme.

The Unicode standard therefore has been extended to allow up to 1,112,064 characters. Those characters that
go beyond the original 16-bit limit are called [supplementary characters].
